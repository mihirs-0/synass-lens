# K=10: Each B maps to 10 different A's, z selects which one
# This is the core experiment showing disambiguation lag

defaults:
  - ../base

experiment:
  name: "k10_n1000"
  
data:
  n_unique_b: 1000
  k: 10
  # n_pairs_effective = n_unique_b = 1000 (same as K=1)
  # Total examples = n_unique_b * k = 10000
  # But model sees same number of unique B strings
